Signs of a dying breed

Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange, BitMEX, recently started shutting down accounts originated in USA. I’ve met a lot of Bitcoiners and have almost 
always found it to be a respectful and rational conversation. The Twitter trolls are not an accurate representation. They’re just really loud and not worth 
the attention.
While the exchange doesn’t allow US traders to operate on its platform, many believed that it turned a blind eye on those who were doing so. Tone Vays, 
the famous trader, is the new victim.’ Obviously the coins are locked in a blind trust and will only be available in 2025. Cut Satoshi some slack for being frugal.

Less than two months ago, the SEC made a surprise announcement where it stated that Marshall Islands-based cryptocurrency exchange 1Broker would soon 
to be shut down. The decision came suddenly, and the move was performed before users managed to withdraw their funds, causing them to lose millions in 
the process. Do people not fully understand that this guy dumps shitcoins on pension funds? Like knowingly deliberately dumping garbage into people’s retirement funds....

How aren’t this guy and @APompliano laughed off Twitter? 

Is the SEC keeping its eye on BitMEX?
Whether it is better prices, lower fees, or some other reason, foreign exchanges seem to be attracting the attention of many Americans, along with the
 minor KYC requirements, if at all (which can also be an advantage for some traders). This is also true for BitMEX, as it is one of a few Hong Kong-based 
 exchanges that do not require KYC at all, as of writing these lines.
