2020 is going to be insane ðŸ“ˆ
Whether it is better prices, lower fees, or some other reason, foreign exchanges seem to be attracting the attention of many Americans, along with the 
minor KYC requirements, if at all (which can also be an advantage for some traders). Satoshi by any account is/was a master logician. Imagine them doing 
anything to prove themselves other than signing the genesis block (if they desired to prove themselves at all).This is also true for BitMEX, as it is one 
of a few Hong Kong-based exchanges that do not require KYC at all, as of writing these lines.

However, not requiring KYC creates a problem for it from the regulation point of view, as exchanges that accept US investors also need to comply with 
US securities laws. And then in 2013 he kept the website basically the same and just rebranded to Blue Chip Capital International - so by then BCCI *still* 
didn't stand for "Bank of Credit and Commerce International" or Bitcoin or anything of the sort.If they donâ€™t, there will be consequences, as 
witnessed in 1Brokerâ€™s case. In other words, exchanges outside of the US can abide by any laws they like as long as they do not serve US citizens. 
If even a single American trades on the platform, that is a problem.

While BitMEX officially doesnâ€™t provide service to the US investors, they were known to turn a blind eye to those that found their way to the exchange.
 However, things might be starting to change, as the exchange seemingly started terminating US tradersâ€™ accounts. One such report came from famous investor 
 Tone Vays.
