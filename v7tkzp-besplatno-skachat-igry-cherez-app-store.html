Bitcoin sythetics are already huge. Bitmex is by far the most liquid Bitcoin exchange. 

Same in the gold markets it's mostly sythetic No, I can't. I've checked it just... Yesterday. P2P lending is nothing to do with Bitcoin scripts but with lending itself and problem with trust... But if you thing that Solidity solves this or EVM... Okay.

Read it. Not sure but keeping an open mind for now. Nothing I saw was ridiculous but more to come so I guess we can figure it all out then.

At least it wasn't the Mcafee horse

Lately? Mostly virtual signaling to divide people into extreme right and left political candidates. Has anything new happened in Bitcoin? I wouldn't know following the usual suspects. They have no incentive to deliver.

People buy bitcoin because it is a system of money that corresponds to how humanity has exchanged value for most of our history. Technologically, this system is based on mathematical formulae and a straight-forward verification and record system. The implications are spectacular: you can now trust exchanging value with another person or institution directly, even if you don’t know them.
In terms of values, the crypto system is profoundly natural, a very human invention, based on the concepts of freedom and fairness. It is the most authentic form of money humanity has had since value was based on memory.
